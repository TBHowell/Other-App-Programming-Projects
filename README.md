# Other-App-Programming-Projects
A collection of all of my application programming class projects. This excludes the phone emulator and calculator app which are in their own respective repositories.

## Project 1
This project is a simple UI project that allowed for a message to be entered into the middle of the screen. The background, foreground, message, and text allignment can all be changed with various buttons and other UI elements.

## Project 2
This project is a little diner menu application that displayed three menu options and an exit button. The picture along with the item description can be changed by clicking on an option.

## Project 3
This project is a hotel reservation application that allows a reservation to be made with a specific room kind, bed arrangment, reservation name, reservation date, reservation duration, and wether or not to include parking. After selecting your options from the first screen a second screen will notify the user of pricing and get a payment option from the user which is then verified. Then a final screen displays a confirmation message including details of the reservation.

## Project 5
This project is an interactive tic tac toe game that has two tabs allowing the user(s) to play with either text entry, or button presses. Upon entering a selection either by pressing a button or entering the coordinates the gamefield is updated with the current players tolken. When an end state is reached the winner (if there is one) is declared and the game can be restarted.

## Project 8
This project is a simple drawing application that includes options to change brush size, and color, as well as the stamp being used. Left clicking and moving the mouse draws with the brush on the canvas, and right clicking stamps the canvas with the currently selected stamp.
